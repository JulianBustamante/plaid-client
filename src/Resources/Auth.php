 * The /auth/get endpoint allows you to collect a user's bank account and

 * performs two crucial functionsâ€”it translates bank access credentials
 * (username & password) into an accurate account and routing number. No input
 * of account or routing number is necessary. Secondly it validates that this
 * is the owner of this account number, in a NACHA compliant manner. No need for
 * micro-deposits or any other secondary authentication.
